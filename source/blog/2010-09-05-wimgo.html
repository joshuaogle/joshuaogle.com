The website that I work on for my day-job, <a href="http://wimgo.com">wimgo</a>, just crossed a big milestone in launching nationally. Wimgo is already the biggest event, movie and business directory in Oklahoma, and now it adds millions and millions more coast to coast. I'm proud to have been a part of making that happen and to show a little of what I worked on specifically. I was given the task of designing the site's new homepage, and along the way I introduced the idea of adding a large map as a way to break down what can sometimes seem like dry lists of data and to showcase what wimgo is really all about: "Where I'm Going". So far the map has been a huge success and is being used as a test case to consider more creative features.
  
I have also been the main designer and front-end developer for wimgo's business resource center, now renamed "my.wimgo.biz". For the national launch, this whole section was split off to it's own domain, and given an all new identity and style. It is much more utilitarian than the main site, but still retains that distinctive "wimgo" feel. (Logo and identity credits go to the illustrious <a href="http://twitter.com/visualinventor">Tim Watson</a>).
