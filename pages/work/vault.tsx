          <h2>It's hard to keep a secret</h2>
          <p>
            Modern web applications require a dizzying number of moving parts,
            including dyanamic resources like servers, databases, and applications
            that are constantly being deployed and changed.
            And to make things more complicated,
            engineering teams at large companies can grow to hundreds or thousands of people
            all needing access to passwords and other secrets.
            So how do you keep anything secure?
          </p>
          
          <Example
            images={[
              "case-studies/vault-loader-dark.gif",
              "case-studies/vault-keys.png"
            ]}
            caption="Vault's first product color was slate gray"
          />

          <p>
            User-friendly password managers are easy to find,
            but that doesn't mean that people use them like they should.
            Vault was made so that developers could integrate secrets management
            into their application from Day 1
            and grow with them as they adopt more dynamic infrastructure.
            An application can authenticate to Vault,
            check that it has the right permissions to access this data,
            and get back a one-time password that expires in just milliseconds.
            Vault does this up to millions of times a day,
            and every single time the identity is checked again
            and the action is logged so it can be reviewed later.
            This means that configuring Vault needed to be easy to understand and human-friendly,
            but <mark>Vault's most frequent users aren't human</mark>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before HashiCorp,
            I had experience at thoughtbot
            leading customers through Google's Design Sprint framework,
            spending a week taking something from initial concept and discovery on Monday
            to prototyping ideas with real users by Friday.
            This kind of lean user testing worked well for consulting clients,
            but would need a few changes to match our long product release cycles
            where a new version of the product comes out every three to four months.

          <h2>The importance of Zero-Trust Security</h2>
          <p>
            You do use a password manager, right?
            Keeping your personal passwords secure is important
            to protect against fraud and identity theft,
            so imagine how much more important it is
            for companies like banks and healthcare providers
            where they are handling sensitive information
            that is even more important than our credit card numbers.
          </p>
          
          <Example
            images={[

          <p>
            User Research for cybersecurity products was... a challenge.
            Our customers were understandably <em>very</em> protective
            of their secrets environments.
            We were never going to get access to real data
            to see how they were using Vault,
            and because the software runs in secure private networks,
            we didn't even have any tracking or analytics in the app at all
            (and still don't, for the record).
            So we would need a simulated environment
            that they could use to show us how their real work is done.
          </p>
          
          <Example
            video="/case-studies/vault-ui-011.mp4"
            caption="Vault 0.11"
          />

          <p>
            We relied on our network of Vault Enterprise customers and open-source community members
            who ranged from experts in cybersecurity operations
            to brand new developers using a secrets management tool for the first time.
            We observed them using clickable prototypes in Figma to mock up workflows,
            including flows between Vault and other apps
            like a terminal or services like AWS.
            Our interview included questions about their work,
            how their teams are organized,
            and how permissions are reviewed and approved.
            We used all of this to build a map of personas
            well beyond just the developers using Vault directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my favorite parts of my job
            is that I get to build things for engineers.
            They've got everything a designer would want
            in an ideal user/customer:
            they're incredibly smart,
            they care a lot about how they work,
            and boy do they have strong opinions!
            I have years of coding experience in a variety of languages
            and I also appreciate when a library or framework feels intuitive and powerful.
            In fact, I had been on a few projects that used HashiCorp tools
            like Vagrant and Terraform,
            so I had some first-hand knowledge that making these tools easier to use
            had a real impact on the work of developers
            all over the world.
          </p>
          
          <Example

          <p>
            I took the incredibly valuable opportunity
            to do resarch in-person at HashiConf,
            our annual conference attended
            by some of our smartest and most invested users.
            I ran small studies by appointment
            and also invited people to come talk to us between talks.
            We made it easy to drop in, give us feedback, and get back to socializing.
            Participants went through several
            of our most important user workflows
            including onboarding,
            storing and retrieving secrets,
            and managing permissions for end-users.
            One of the biggest things impacting the user experience
            was that if things weren't absolutely clear and obvious,
            they would spend time going back to check and recheck
            that they did what they thought they did.
          </p>

          <p>
            I took our observations and refined the small details like clear actions,
            adding a confirmation step, and included helpful info
            to make sure they felt confident making changes.

            HashiCorp <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/news/hashicorp-vault-enterprise-release-enables-150000673.html">had just announced Vault Enterprise</a>.
            Vault's open source project was already becoming the standard among open source users,
            and it had quite a fan base.
            HashiCorp knew that the security engineers, platform engineers, and compliance officers
            that would be using the Enterprise version
            needed a user interface that gave them more discoverability and visibility
            into their secrets management environment.

            Designing complex systems means spending quite a lot of time thinking
            about how to make things reusable and composable.
            After all, you don't get to start from scratch every day
            so I think you should take advantage of it and do it right.
            These designs weren't just the future of Vault,
            it was the future of our whole design team at HashiCorp.
            To help the designers that we were onboarding quickly and to help keep our products consistent,
            I led the working group that created <Link href="structure">our first design system named Structure</Link>.

          <div className="section-title">UI Guide</div>
          <h2>Everybody could use a Guide</h2>
          <p>
            It's no surprise that a tool like Vault has a bit of a learning curve.
            Getting everything configured and integrated into your application could take hours
            (many people even split it up over several days!).
            The user may be learning about how secrets engines, authentication methods,
            and access control policies work for the first time
            and are anxious about doing things right.
            We want best practices the be the default
            and organizations to feel confident that their data is safe,
            so I designed a new "UI Guide" component
            that helps you learn about how to use Vault and the Web UI.
            This would be a very new kind of component for our design system,
            one that was dynamic and integrated into the entire application,
            guiding the user through new workflows,
            whether it is their first time doing it
            or to help make sure they remember the next time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had a few important rules for this new experience:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Greet first-time users but be easily dismissed</li>
            <li>Onboarding with a carousel of images or videos isn't good enough.</li>
            <li>Stay with them as you they get to know the real application and build muscle memory.</li>
            <li>Don't expect them to remember next time, so make it easy to find after it is closed.</li>
            <li>Our users are smart! <mark>Don't talk down to them.</mark></li>
          </ul>

            HashiCorp is a remote-first company, and always has been.
            The culture around writing things down clearly for asynchronous review was very strong,
            and every major change from any corner of the company had an RFC that went with it.
            RFC stands for "Request for Comments"
            and while getting a second-opinion from every engineer
            in a two-thousand person company is pretty scary,
            I think that this process is how we kept our culture of humility and openness.
            I wrote an Design RFC documenting the capabilities and experience
            of the Guide component,
            how it would appear and be dismissed,
            how it organized information
            and showed progress.
            I even created a multi-page spreadsheet detailing all of the text and states
            that we would need for each section,
            keeping things organized for our front-end developers
            who would need to get all of it into code.
            Through their feedback, the design team helped me craft this component
            into one that could be used in all of our products,
            building in some of the flexibility and customization
            that they would need right from the start.
          </p>
          
          <Example

          />

          <p>
            We used a state machine to keep track of the application state,
            including what "tracks" the user had selected,
            such as "Secrets Engines" or "Access Control Policies",
            and their progress through each one.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Vault UI Guide launched in 2019
            and was a big hit with our users,
            especially admins who spent time onboarding new developers.
            It was a big step forward for our design system
            and how we collaborated on complex components.

          <p>
            In 2020, the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) was created
            to bring our multicloud automation tools all into one place.
            This was especially exciting for Vault
            because this means you wouldn't have to worry
            about privisioning, and deploying a Vault server,
            we could do that for you.
            At this point, the Vault product design team had grown to four
            and we needed someone who understood the complexities
            of how our products fit together,
            so I moved my focus to HCP Vault
            and left the core product in their good hands.
          </p>

          <Example

          <p>
            Our Product Manager joined me for dozens of customer interviews
            where we heard a consistent story:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            We want the confidence of using Vault,
            but without the headache of setting it up ourselves.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            We wanted to bring Vault to the cloud platform
            but we also wanted to time the release with our HashiDays event
            and the platform wasn't quite ready to support all of Vault's capabilities quite yet.
            We made the decision to use HCP as a managed service provider,
            hosting and managing Vault for them but serving as a portal
            to the already popular Vault Web UI.
          </p>
          <p>
            HCP Vault launched in January 2021.
            I had designed a simple workflow for provisioning a Vault cluster
            and a friendly dashboard where you could see the cluster's status on HCP.
            Within a week there were hundreds of new Vault clusters
            created by customers varying from retail businesses and banks
            to government entities I'm not allowed to mention.
            <mark>Secrets management was more accessible than ever.</mark>

            If you design or build software,
            I can't overemphasize the importance
            of learning systems design.
            Whether it is a simple mobile app
            or sophisticated access controls for highly dynamic infrastructure,
